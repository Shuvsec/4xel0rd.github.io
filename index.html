                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>I’m Suvam Barui, a cybersecurity professional with a passion for securing systems, uncovering vulnerabilities, and contributing to a safer digital world. I recently graduated in Master’s in Computing Security from Rochester Institute of Technology, I specialize in penetration testing, vulnerability management, and secure software development. With a commitment to ethical practices and continuous learning, I strive to protect organizations from ever-evolving cyber threats.

                I excel at identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across web applications, Linux, and Windows environments. Leveraging tools like Metasploit, Nessus, Snort, and Burp Suite, I deliver actionable insights to enhance system security postures. In addition to penetration testing, I develop secure, scalable applications with a focus on automation and security best practices, utilizing technologies like Ansible and Docker. Security is not an afterthought in my work—it’s integrated from the start. As a freelance security researcher, I have worked with international clients to provide comprehensive threat analysis and security solutions, reflecting a meticulous and proactive approach to safeguarding digital assets.

My journey in cybersecurity is fueled by a relentless drive to master new tools and techniques. I hold a CompTIA Security+ certification and am currently pursuing OSCP. Platforms like Hack The Box, where I rank as a Pro Hacker, and TryHackMe, where I am in the Top 1%, allow me to consistently sharpen my skills and stay ahead in this rapidly evolving field. For me, cybersecurity is not just about technical expertise—it’s about understanding human behavior, anticipating threats, and designing solutions that make a lasting impact.

Whether you’re looking for a cybersecurity consultant, a penetration tester, or a collaborator on security research, I’d love to hear from you.
